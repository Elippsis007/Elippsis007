- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike aka Elippsis007

- 👀 I’m interested in Front End and Back End frameworks and all aspects of what will make me a strong, capable Software Developer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Development with CodeInstitute since February 2021 and loving it!

- 💞️ At this particular time I’m not looking to collaborate on anything just yet until I feel confident in my coding skills.

- 📫 How to reach me: Contact me here on GitHub or by email - michaeldrmm@gmail.com
